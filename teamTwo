Making the perfect batch of chocolate chip cookies 


1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
¾ cup granulated sugar
¾ cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (or chocolate chunks)
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

Mix dry ingredients: In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

Cream butter and sugars: In a large bowl, beat together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until creamy and smooth.

Add eggs: Beat in the eggs one at a time, making sure each is fully mixed before adding the next.

Combine wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined.

Stir in chocolate chips (and nuts, if using).

Scoop the dough: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown around the edges but still soft in the center.

Cool: Let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
